      I&apos;m Executive Chef Anthony Redmond. I enjoy teasing the senses to enrage
      the appetite, making his guest suffer a voracious need to devour the delicious
      dishes before them. On this site I will take the users on a journey meant to
      arouse each of the culinary senses: Aroma, taste, feel, until one can literally
      hear one&apos;s growling stomach demanding to be satisfied.
  
      Within also are tools to help those across the full spectrum of from home chef to professional,
      &quot;What&apos;s a spatula&quot; to &quot;tempering eggs is indeed an art,
      but an attainable one&quot; achieve dishes that will thrill them through
      every stage: prep, cooking, and eating; delighting their guests.
